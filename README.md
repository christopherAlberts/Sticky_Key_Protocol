# Sticky_Key_Protocol
Keylogger that logs all keys to a .bat file

When the following code is executed, a .bat will be created that contains a log of all the keys pressed up until the escape button is pressed.Â 

**DO NOT CLICK ON THE BAT FILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

When the program runs, it not only saves all the info to the .bat file. It also creates a Seppuku Protocol. What this means is that when the .bat file is clicked it will not only kill itself, but it will also remove the .jar file.
